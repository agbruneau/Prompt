# AI Prompt Templates Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of text files, each serving as a detailed prompt or system configuration for Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The primary focus of these prompts is to guide AI agents in performing tasks related to theological analysis, particularly within Reformed and Calvinist doctrinal frameworks. Additionally, some prompts address methodologies for prompt engineering and general analytical problem-solving.

The prompts typically define:
*   The AI's role and expertise.
*   The context and objectives of the task.
*   Specific doctrinal or methodological frameworks to adhere to.
*   Detailed instructions for processing inputs and structuring outputs.
*   Requirements for reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) and source citation.

## File Descriptions

Below is a summary of each file found in this repository:

*   **`2.42 - 5 Questions`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines an AI role as a "Theological Analyst expert in Reformed doctrine" and "Biblical Study Facilitator."
    *   **Task**: To extract key teachings from a sermon transcription (aligned with Reformed theology), formulate a central lesson for meditation, and create five open-ended questions suitable for a group Bible study. Emphasizes adherence to specific Reformed confessions (Westminster Standards, Three Forms of Unity).

*   **`Enseignement.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A prompt for an AI acting as an "Analyst Théologique expert in the Reformed tradition."
    *   **Task**: To analyze a GPT discussion transcript to identify, extract, and formulate theological, ethical, and practical teachings that are present or implicit in the exchange, strictly align with classical Reformed theology, and are conducive to personal meditation and spiritual edification.

*   **`LiteratureReview.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A request for an AI to generate a structured literature review.
    *   **Task**: To produce a literature review on the topic "Systems Interoperability in 2025 and the future," including key research themes, important studies, ongoing debates, literature gaps, and suggestions for future research, using peer-reviewed sources and IEEE citation style.

*   **`MetaPrompt.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A detailed template for an AI designated as an "Expert Prompt Generator and Optimizer."
    *   **Task**: To assist users in creating or refining AI prompts. This meta-prompt guides the AI to ensure the generated prompts are clear, well-structured, verifiable, and minimize AI hallucinations, incorporating principles like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and a "Standard Prompt Structure."

*   **`PostCast.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Contains brief notes on desired qualities for a conversation.
    *   **Task**: Unclear in isolation, but likely expresses a desire for AI-generated (or other) content to be optimally structured for listener attention, complete, detailed, pedagogical, and well-organized.

*   **`Prose.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A system prompt for an AI to extract a single, central Reformed teaching (from a Puritan perspective) from a preceding GPT discussion.
    *   **Task**: To distill a core teaching suitable for nourishing piety and reflection, with a strict output format: a concise title (max 6 words) and a single, theologically dense meditative sentence (ideally ≤ 500 words).

*   **`Question.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A template for an AI acting as an "Exegete and Theological Analyst Expert of the Reformed Tradition."
    *   **Task**: To perform an exhaustive theological analysis of the Epistle to the Galatians, chapter by chapter. This includes identifying three key teachings per chapter, explaining how the glory of the Trinitarian God is manifested in Christ for each, summarizing three major doctrinal themes from the epistle, and formulating a principal precept for meditation. Requires citation of at least 10 academic/theological sources from 5 different categories.

*   **`Structuration.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A system configuration for an AI designated as an "Analytical and Adaptive Problem Solver."
    *   **Task**: To approach complex problems submitted by users with rigor and method. It mandates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodology, structured responses including confidence levels and justifications, and adherence to operational guidelines regarding regulated domains and data privacy.

*   **`Theologisation.txt`**:
    *   **Purpose**: A template for an AI acting as an "Expert Assistant in Theology according to John MacArthur and Rigorous Exegete."
    *   **Task**: To answer theological questions, interpret biblical passages, and discuss doctrines strictly from John MacArthur's theological perspective (Calvinist soteriology, cessationism, dispensational premillennialism, historico-grammatical literal exegesis). An extensive Appendix A details MacArthur's specific doctrinal positions to be followed.

## Common Characteristics

Many prompts in this repository share common features:

*   **Specific Theological Frameworks**: A strong emphasis on adherence to particular theological systems, notably Reformed theology, Calvinism, and the specific teachings of John MacArthur.
*   **Methodological Rigor**: Frequent requirements for structured reasoning processes like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and specific interpretive methods such as historico-grammatical literal exegesis for biblical texts.
*   **Detailed Output Formatting**: Precise instructions on how the AI's response should be structured, often including templates for headings, content organization, and even sentence length or word count for certain elements.
*   **Interpretive Hierarchies and Source Citation**: Clear guidelines on the priority of instructions (e.g., system prompt over user instructions) and requirements for citing biblical, theological, or academic sources.

## Potential Use

These files can be used as foundational templates for developing or guiding AI models to perform specialized tasks, particularly in the domain of theological research and education, as well as for creating robust and well-defined prompts for other complex AI applications.
