REQUEST : 
1.) My problem: 
You are a expert [in Reformed Theology]. I have a problem I need you to solve. I need you to [answer this question : What are the 5 main teachings to be learned from chapter 11 of the Gospel of Mark? Give details based on the Reformed Theology]. By the end of this cycle we should be left with one winner. 

2.) Brainstorming solutions: 
Now that you understand the problem I am dealing with, I need you to brainstorm 3 solutions for fixing this problem. When providing these solutions, think about why you selected each one and list 3 components or factors that went into choosing that solution.

3.) Probability Evaluation: 
For each solution listed, I now need you to evaluate their probability of success. When evaluating their success probability I want you to keep these factors in mind: Pros and cons of each solution, difficulty to perform, challenges, outcome expectations, the scope of the problem, who or what the problem is dealing with, and the impact of the solutions. Give each solution a success probability. This success probability can be measured by percentages of 1%-100%. Give reasoning on how you came to the percentage conclusion. 

4.) Exclude Losers, Isolate Winner: 
Now that we have these solutions to my problem, rated by percentage I want to have the two solutions with the lowest percentages removed. Keep and write a condensed summary of the solution with the highest percentage only and list its probability of success once again. Then you need to start a brainstorming loop and run through this loop three times: 

5.) Brainstorming Competitive Solutions:
Let me reiterate my problem once again: [answer this question : What are the 5 main teachings to be learned from chapter 11 of the Gospel of Mark?? Give details based on the Reformed Theology]. Now take a look at the winning solution you found. I need you to brainstorm two more winning ideas that could have potentially better results than our first winning solution at fixing my problem. When providing these 2 new solutions, provide 3 components that go into making that solution effective. Also, add our current winning solution within this list so we have a total of 3 solutions. For now, just list the solutions and the 3 components that go into making it successful, donâ€™t worry about the probability evaluation for these 2 new ideas. 

6.) Probability Evaluation:
 For each solution listed, I now need you to evaluate their probability of success. When evaluating their success probability I want you to keep these factors in mind: Pros and cons of each solution, difficulty to perform, challenges, outcome expectations, the scope of the problem, who or what the problem is dealing with, and the impact of the solutions. Give each solution a success probability. This success probability can be measured by percentages of 1%-100%. Give reasoning on how you came to the percentage conclusion. 

7.) Exclude Losers, Isolate Winner:
 Now that we have these solutions to my problem, rated by percentage I want to have the two solutions with the lowest percentages removed. Keep and write a summary of the solution with the highest percentage only and list its probability of success once again. 
Repeat This Loop (steps 5-7) 3 times before arriving at a final answer. 
Finally, give me the winning solution after all iterations of this loop and why you gave me this solution.
